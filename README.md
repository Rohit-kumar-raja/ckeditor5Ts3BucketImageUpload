To set up a Laravel 11 project with the repository provided and configure it with S3, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Composer installed on your machine.
- Ensure you have the necessary credentials for AWS S3.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rohit-kumar-raja/ckeditor5Ts3BucketImageUpload.git
    ```
    Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ckeditor5Ts3BucketImageUpload
    ```

2. **Install Composer Dependencies**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Add S3 Credentials in `.env` File**
    Open the `.env` file in the root of the project and add your S3 credentials:
    ```env
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_region
    AWS_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
    ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**
    Ensure you have your database configured in the `.env` file. Then run:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5. **Run the Application**
    Start the Laravel development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    Your application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Additional Steps (If Any)

- If the project uses npm or yarn for front-end dependencies, you might also need to run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
  or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn run dev
    ```

- If there are any additional configuration steps or setup processes specific to this project, refer to the project's README file or any provided documentation.

By following these steps, you should have a working Laravel 11 project integrated with S3 for image uploads.
